# Referral Program

UmAI offers a referral system that benefits both the person sharing their referral code and the person using it. This page explains how it works, how to apply a code, and what benefits you get.

***

## How the Referral System Works

The referral program is built around **performance fee discounts**. Here is the basic flow:

1. An existing UmAI user (or partner) has a unique referral code.
2. A new user visits UmAI using a link that includes that referral code.
3. The referral code is applied to the new user's account.
4. The new user receives a modified performance fee rate.
5. The referral code holder receives a share of the performance fees generated by the referred user.

Both parties benefit -- the referred user gets a better deal on fees, and the referrer earns passive income from the users they bring in.

***

## Applying a Referral Code

Referral codes are applied through a **URL parameter**. There is no separate input field in the app.

### How to Apply

1.  Receive a referral link from someone. It will look like this:

    ```
    https://app.umai.finance/?ref=CODE
    ```

    where `CODE` is the unique referral code.
2. Open the link in your browser.
3. Connect your wallet.
4. The referral code is automatically applied to your account.

That is it. No extra steps needed.

### Important Rules

> **One-time application.** Once a referral code is applied to your account, it cannot be changed or removed. You cannot switch to a different referral code later.

> **Apply before depositing.** Make sure to visit the referral link and connect your wallet **before** making your first deposit to ensure the code is properly applied.

> **No self-referral.** You cannot use your own referral code.

## How Referral Affects Fee Rates

Without a referral code, the **default performance fee rate is 35%** of earned trading fees.

When a valid referral code is applied, the fee structure is adjusted:

* The referred user may receive a reduced performance fee rate.
* The exact discount depends on the specific referral arrangement.
* The referral code holder receives a share of the performance fees collected from the referred user's deposits.

> **Note:** When a referral code is applied, its fee rate **overrides** the lock-period-based fee rate entirely. The lock period still determines when you can withdraw, but the referral code controls your performance fee rate. See [Lock Periods](lock-periods.md) for details on lock durations.

## Benefits for Referral Code Holders

If you hold a referral code and share it with others, you earn a portion of the performance fees generated by the users you refer. This is a passive income stream that grows as more people deposit through your link.

Key points:

* Earnings are proportional to the performance fees collected from your referred users.
* The more your referrals deposit and the longer they stay, the more you earn.
* Referral earnings are tracked on-chain and can be claimed through the platform.

## Default Fee Rate (No Referral)

If you deposit without applying any referral code:

* Your default performance fee rate is **35%** of earned trading fees.
* This rate is then modified based on your chosen [lock period](lock-periods.md).
* No referral benefits are applied.

> **Tip:** If someone you know uses UmAI, ask them for their referral code before you make your first deposit. It costs nothing and can reduce your fees.
